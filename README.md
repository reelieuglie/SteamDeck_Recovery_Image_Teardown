# What this is
I'm taking the time to tear apart the SteamDeck Image. 

# Why I'm doing this
For fun. 

# But someone else has done this, and they have more information

Probably. I'll try to link any references or things I stumble across as I go along. 

# This is very disorganized

Yes, as am I. I'll do my best to organize it, but whatever. 

# You are doing this wrong, it's much easier done $thisWay

I'm sure, and you are welcome to provide any tips/insights in `issues`, but I'm not interested in doing this the most efficient way. This is for fun. 

# You are wrong. 

Always am.
